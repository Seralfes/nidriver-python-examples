    Gain Bandwidth: The frequency at which the unloaded loop gain extrapolates to 0 dB in the absence of additional poles and zeroes. Value range = 10 Hz to 20 MHz
    Compensation Frequency: The frequency at which a pole-zero pair is added to the system when the channel is in Constant Voltage mode. Value range = 20 Hz to 20 MHz
    Pole Zero Ratio: The ratio of the pole frequency to the zero frequency when the channel is in Constant Voltage/Current mode. Value range = 0.125 to 8.0

    Note: Do be careful about hardcoding custom transient settings. The default values for SLOW/NORMAL/FAST are voltage range/current range/device specific, so hardcoding would be helpful only when using 
    an identical device at the identical voltage/current ranges. It is recommended to use the default values, and if customization is necessary, to read back the values for each of the defaults and start from there.
